This web app was made primarily with Angular 4 and the Angular CLI, Typescript, and the Firebase Database. It's purpose is to show off my week four knowledge from Epicodus and my efficiency with the above. This club tracker is a simple app designed to give the user the ability to see a list of club members as well as view their specific details on a dynamic page. The user can also sort the users by certain properties (rank in club for example). There is also an admin side that allows the admins to create, update, and delete members.

## Landing Page:

## Planning

### 1. Configuration/dependencies
  The app will primarily use Angular 4, the AngularCLI, Firebase database, and Typescript. It was made with what I learned from week 4 at Epicodus. Stretch goals include:
    * Using Sass to style the page better.
    * Hosting the site live

### 2. User Stories
  * As a user, I'd like to visit a page to see a list of all team or club members.
  * As a user, I'd like to click a team or club member's entry in the list to visit their profile page, which should include more details about them.
  * As a user, I'd like the option to visit an "About" page that explains what the club is, and what they do.
  * As a user, I'd like all data persisted in a database, so it's always there when I need it.
  * As a user, I'd like to filter the list of users by their particular role in the group, or some other information/category. (For instance, a club may have a treasurer, president, and/or secretary. A sports team may have a goalie, forward, or striker, a book club may have founders and attendees. You're also welcome to filter by something other than role, if it's more relevant to your project.)
  * As an administrator, I want to add new users to the club. (User authentication is not required).
  * As an administrator, I want to edit user profiles, in case I make a mistake, or need to update their details.
  * As an administrator, need the option to delete a user, in case they leave the club or team.

### 3. Integration
  * Root component/Index page.
  * Contact page
  * About page
  * List members page.
  * Dynamic members pages.
  * Admin page with CRUD functionality for members

### 4. UX/UI
  * Include Bootstrap, sass is a stretch goal.

### 5. Polish
  * Refactor code.
  * Delete unused code.
  * Make README awesome.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Angular 4](https://angularjs.org/)

## Installation

As of writing this README, these instructions work on MacOS.

* Run `$ git clone <this-repository-url>`
* Then `$ cd club-tracker`
* Once in the club-tracker folder, run `$ npm install` and `$ bower install`
* You will need to remake the api-keys.ts file. Login to firebase and create your own project here https://firebase.google.com/
  * Once logged in, click on 'Go To Console'.
  * Then click 'Add project', give it a name, and select your region.
  * Next, click 'Add Firebase to your web app'.
  * Grab this block of code:
```
var config = {
    apiKey: "xxxx",
    authDomain: "xxxx.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://xxxx.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "xxxx",
    storageBucket: "",
    messagingSenderId: "xxxx"
  };
```
  * Create an `api-keys.ts` file inside the app directory and copy the block of code into it.
  * Replace `var config` with `export var masterFirebaseConfig`
  * To finish setting firebase up, go to firebase and and go into the database tab.
    * Click on the button made of three dots.
    * Select the Import JSON option.
    * Select browse, navigate to the project folder, and open the `sample-members.json` file.
    * Select Import and your database should be complete!

## Running / Development

Now that everything you need should be installed and setup, we can run it with angular.

* Run `$ ng serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
